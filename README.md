# Asnme

## Current Status

This project is currently inactive due to lack of time and other priorities.

## What is this?

Asnme is a management application for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) databases. It is a desktop application written in C++ and Qt and will (eventually) be available on Windows, Linux and Mac.

It is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3. Please see the LICENSE file for further information.

## Why?

I am a Linux user and there are currently no desktop GUI applications that I could find for managing your MongoDBs. Yes I know the command-line is king but somethings I need my eye-candy.

I am also using this as a chance to learn C++ and the [Qt framework](http://qt.nokia.com/)

## Why this name?

On #mongodb channel of irc.freenode.net:

    <RurouniJones> Hrmm, As a learning experience I am writing a MongoDB manager app using Qt and I need a snappy name. Any suggestions?
    <Buttons840> "A Snappily Named MongoDB Experiment"

And now you know.

## Development

This program was created using the Qt Creator IDE.

### MongoDB

This program requires the MongoDB C++ driver to be compiled and linked on your system. Please follow the instructions at the MongoDB [C++ Language Center](http://www.mongodb.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=133409).

Once this is done copy the contents of the driver directory to the mongo directory of this project.
